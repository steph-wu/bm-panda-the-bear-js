1. Select the element that contains the profile image (hint: look for the class). Change the src attribute so it points to a picture of your choosing instead (hint: use attr()).

  $('img.profile-image').attr('src', 'http://placehold.it/400x400')

2. Use the same approach to select the element that contains the photo of the sky and change the src attribute to another picture URL of your choosing.

  $('#left-image img').attr('src', 'http://cdn3-www.cattime.com/assets/uploads/2011/08/best-kitten-names-1.jpg')
